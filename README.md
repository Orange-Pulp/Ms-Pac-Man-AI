# Q-learning Atari AI

(Game library) ▼

You can change the game this AI learns by going to line 74 and changing the gym.make variable to any other game in the Open-AI gym library. Here is a link to all of the games. Some work better then others with this specific learning algorithm.  https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari



(Working enviroment ▼)

This project was built with slightly older syntax from tensorflow 1.15.0 and may not work with some builds of tensorflow 2.0. I reccomend using a docker file or virtual enviroment if you regularly use tensorflow 2.
